‚úÖ Summary Points (Overall Content & Process)

Dataset Acquisition

Either upload CSV manually, or fetch it via Kaggle API.

Store dataset in Colab (/content) or Google Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/...).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Inspect dataset shape, columns, data types.

Check missing values, describe statistics, detect target variable (e.g., Price).

Preprocessing

Drop unnecessary ID/index columns.

Fill missing numeric values with median, categorical with mode.

Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.

Ensure target column remains separate.

Feature & Target Split

Define X (independent features) and y (target).

Train-Test Split & Scaling

Split dataset into train (80%) and test (20%).

Standardize numeric features with StandardScaler.

Model Training (Linear Regression)

Fit LinearRegression() from scikit-learn on scaled features.

Train model to predict target values.

Model Evaluation

Metrics: MAE, MSE, R¬≤.

Print top positive & negative feature coefficients, and intercept.

Visualization

Scatter plot: Predicted vs Actual values.

Regression line for most correlated feature vs target.

Model Saving

Save model and scaler using joblib.

Save plots (pred_vs_actual.png, simple_regression.png).

Exporting Results

Save outputs in Google Drive folder, or

Download files directly to local device using files.download().

GitHub Upload

Push notebook (.ipynb), outputs, and README to GitHub.

Use Colab ‚ÄúSave a copy to GitHub‚Äù or git push from terminal with a PAT.

üéØ Interview Questions (from your Task 3 topic)

1. What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?

Linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, normal distribution of residuals, no multicollinearity.

2. How do you interpret regression coefficients?

Each coefficient represents the expected change in target variable for a one-unit increase in the predictor, holding others constant.

3. What is R¬≤ (coefficient of determination)?

It indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. R¬≤ closer to 1 = better fit.

4. Difference between MAE and MSE?

MAE = average absolute errors, robust to outliers.

MSE = average squared errors, penalizes large errors more.

5. How can you detect multicollinearity?

By calculating Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or checking high correlation among predictors.

6. Simple vs Multiple Linear Regression?

Simple: one independent variable.

Multiple: two or more independent variables.

7. Can Linear Regression be used for classification?

Not suitable; Logistic Regression or classification models are preferred.

8. What happens if assumptions are violated?

Model may produce biased/inconsistent estimates, poor predictive performance.

Remedies: feature engineering, transformations, or switching to robust models.

9. Why do we scale features before regression?

To ensure coefficients are comparable and prevent bias toward features with large magnitudes.

10.What are some alternatives if Linear Regression doesn‚Äôt fit well?

Polynomial regression, Ridge/Lasso regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosted models.
